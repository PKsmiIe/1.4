        <h1>Climate Change</h1>
        To understand Climate Change, you need to know what the climate actually is. The climate is the usual weather of a place. Weather changes from day to day, one day it may be sunny, the next it is pouring with rain, sometimes it's cold and other times it's hot. This also changes from place to place. We might be stuck in eternal cold in New Zealand, but people from Australia could be chilling in the beach lazing in the sun. All these different places have their own "climates." And then there's Earths climate, which is just combining the climates of the whole world into one.
        <br> <br> Climate Change is, well, a change in Earths climate. This could be a change in Earths usual temperature, or it could be a change in weather that isn't a normal part of that particular place. For example, if we in NZ start getting warm days that don't rain. Weather changes often. But Climate can take hundreds or even millions of years to change, though judging by the rate at which we're living, that could may well be happening now.

                Climate change has always been happening, Earth has been both colder and warmer than it is now in the past, of course, thousands and millions of years ago. Currently, the Earth is getting warmer. It has gone up one degree Fahrenheit in the last 100 years, which may not seem like much, but this has caused snow and ice to melt, oceans to rise, and has even affected the growth of plants. <br> <br> Although the Earths climate is naturally changed over time due to its distance from the sun, or the sun sending out more, or less, energy. Volcanoes erupting, oceans rising and falling. A big contributing factor are humans. Cars, for one, but even then, we all use heaters and coolers, we cook food. This doesn't seem like much, but over 7billion people makes the smallest thing a big difference. Not to mention the gasses that we put in the air which cause the air to subsequently heat up.

        <h1>Relevant Implications</h1>
        Climate Change will impact our agriculture, our ecosystems, our health and wellbeing. Our food is becoming less available and what is left is being contaminated. New diseases are forming in the ever changing climate, not to mention the flooding, heatwaves and extreme temperatures. Unfortunately this is most affecting those on the bottom of the social ladder. Those already disadvantaged and in poor health causing loss of livelihoods and forced migrations. The health implications of Climate Change include increases in heart related illnesses and death, extreme weather related injuries and mortalities, aggravated chronic illnesses, easier spread of infectious diseases. The list continues. Climate change impacts on health will have major implications on the future costs of healthcare and services resulting in a world where only the rich live good lives, while the rest suffer just like those old dystopian movies you’d watch on TV.
        <br> <br> Climate change increases the risk for worker’s health and safety. Workers, especially those who work outdoors or in hot indoor environments, are at increased risk of heat stress and other heat-related disorders, occupational injuries, and reduced productivity at work. New approaches have been created to measure and assess worker’s heat exposure and the risk of heat-related disorders. In addition, increased temperature may increase the workers exposure to hazardous chemicals and harmful effects of chemicals on their health. Global warming will influence the distribution of weeds, insect pests, and pathogens, and will introduce new pests, all of which could change the types and amounts of pesticides used, thereby affecting the health of agricultural workers and others. Increased ambient temperatures may contribute to chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology among workers. Global warming is increasing ground-level ozone concentrations with adverse effects on outdoor workers and others. Extreme weather events related to climate change pose injury risks to rescue and recovery workers.
        <br> <br> Climate change can impact people who live in areas that are vulnerable to droughts, coastal storms, and the rising of sea levels etc, and also individuals that are in poverty. Countries may also face economic challenges as, tourism, commerce, and agriculture may also be affected due to natural disasters. The availability of agricultural products such as wheat, can be affected by climate change directly through impacts on crop yields, crop pests, diseases, soil fertility and soil water-holding properties. Water is one of the most serious impacts of climate change, as it affects water resources around the world. Water is intimately tied to other resources and social issues such as food supply, health, industry, transportation and ecosystem integrity. By 2050, more than a billion people in the Asian region (Central, South, East and South-East Asia) are expected to be affected from freshwater shortages due to climate change. Additionally, a great number of people between 75 million and 250 million in the African region are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change.

        <h1 id="padding">Our 3D Model</h1>
        <div class="parallax">
            The purpose of this 3d model, is to inform people around the world that, climate change is a real threat to humanity, that will change people's lives forever. Climate change is the reason why continents such as antarctica are melting rapidly, why there is an increase in the earth's average temperature, and why there is an increase in natural disasters such as heatwaves. Scientists have also proven that, the acceleration in global warming is due to greenhouse emissions from human activities such as travelling to work everyday by car, which emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
            <br> <br> “Climate change is no longer some far-off problem, its happening here, it is happening now”.
            Barack Obama -President of the United States of America.
